# Testing Distributed Systems in DSLab Framework Using Model Checking

<u>By Konstantin Amelichev under supervise of Oleg Sukhoroslov</u>

## Annotation

During the testing of distributed systems, it is crucial to examine all possible states that the system can get into.
This research uses model checking as a formal method to test distributed systems within the context of the <<Distributed Systems>> course assignments.
The simulations are conducted using the DSLab framework.
We propose various optimizations for model checking, including the DependencyResolver module, as well as the introduction of two special workflows: Instant and Collect modes.
These methods have successfully discovered over 10 previously unknown bugs in the archive of assignment solutions.

**Keywords:** Model checking, distributed systems, automated software testing, discrete event simulation.
